Voter Before/After Every Flip-Flop Algorithms
=============================================

There are several ways to place voters in a TMR netlist. This example covers the
two simplest ways: placing voters before every flip-flop, and placing voters
after every flip-flop.

The only difference in the process between these algorithms and other algorithms
that SpyDrNet TMR implements occurs when finding the insertion points for the
voters. In this example, two netlists are composed. One that uses the
`find_before_ff_voter_points` function to find insertion points for
voters, and one that uses the `find_after_ff_voter_points` function.
