        "\n# YAML Configuration Mode for Triplication\n\nIn order to ease the use of SpyDrNet-TMR and allow for complex replication/voter\ninsertion, support for YAML configurations has been implemented. A configuration\nfile for SpyDrNet-TMR is organized as the following:\n\n```yaml\n# Replication options for both instances and top-level ports\nreplication:\n    instances_to_replicate:\n        <instance_option>\n    ports_to_replicate:\n        <port_option>\n\nvoter_insertion:\n    <voter_algorithm_name>:\n        instances_at_valid_points:\n            <instance_option>\n        ports_at_valid_points:\n            <port_option>\n```\nInstance options include the following:\n    - `all`: include all instances\n    - `none`: exclude all instances\n    - `exclude_prim: [\"<primitve_name>\"]`: include all instances except for ones of primtive types listed\n    - `exclude_hinst: [\"<hinst_name>\"]`: include all instances except for the hierachircal instance names given\n\nPort options include the following:\n    - `all`: include all top-level ports\n    - `none`: exclude all top-level ports\n    - `top_level_input_ports`: only include all top-level input ports\n    - `top_level_output_ports`: only include all top-level output ports\n    - `top_level_inoutput_ports`: only include all top-level in/output ports\n    - `exclude_ports: [\"<port_name>\"]`: include all top-level ports except for the port names given\n\nVoter insertion algorithm names come from the module/function names found in\nthe `spydrnet_tmr/analysis/voter_insertion/` directory. The algorithm name is\nmatched with the modules/functions in that directory in the following manner:\n`find_<voter_algorithm_name>_points.py`. The given algorithm name in a\nconfiguration file must excatly match an algorithm from the algorithms in the\nmentioned drectory.\n\n    - Example:\n        - `<voter_algorithm_name>` for `find_after_ff_voter_points.py` would be `after_ff`\n        - `<voter_algorithm_name>` for `find_after_ff_voter_points.py` would be `after_ff`\n"
