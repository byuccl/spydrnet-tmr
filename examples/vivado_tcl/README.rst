Vivado TMR Accross Hiearchy TCL
-------------------------------

These tcl scripts are used to apply TMR accross hiearchy in Vivado. There is a small difference between the different scripts. I am not sure of the significances between the differences at first glance.

This script works well on small simple designs. When designs get bigger, this script can't handle it.
